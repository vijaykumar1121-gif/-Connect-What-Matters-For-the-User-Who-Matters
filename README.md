  - Every section and sub-section comes with a *why*—so you trust the results.
- **Built for the Judge’s Checklist:**
  - Model size? ✔️
  - Speed? ✔️
  - Generalizes to any domain? ✔️
  - No internet? ✔️
  - Output format? Beautiful and compliant. ✔️

## 🏆 Innovation Highlights

- **Few-Shot Learning:**
  - Adapts instantly to new personas and jobs—no retraining needed.
- **Hierarchical Attention:**
  - Understands documents like a human: sections, subsections, context.
- **Contrastive Learning:**
  - Learns what *doesn’t* matter, not just what does.
- **Human-Readable Explanations:**
  - No more “black box” AI. Every output is justified in plain English.
- **Cross-Document Insights:**
  - Aggregates entities and topics across your whole collection.
- **Sentiment & Subjectivity:**
  - Tells you not just what’s there, but how it’s written.
